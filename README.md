## Overview
The goal of this brief course is to provide you with a fun introduction to the world of Data Science with Python.

#### Here's what we'll be doing:
* Overview of basic Python and programming concepts
* Building a simple application using Python
* Playing around and break things



## Setting up your computer


#### Please set up the following:

* A web browser to see what we're working on as others see it (Recommend Google Chrome: [chrome.google.com] (http://chrome.google.com))

* We're going to use [Google Colab](colab.research.google.com) so you will need a Google account if you want to save your own copy.

Well... that was easy! 


## What this workshop is

A super friendly introduction to Python No previous experience expected! 

You can't learn EVERYTHING in ~2 hours. But you can learn enough to get excited and comfortable to keep working and learning on your own! I will link to some resources, and I can email them to you later!

- This course is for absolute beginners
- Ask Questions!
- Answer Questions!
- Help others when you can
- Its ok to get stuck, just ask for help!
- Feel free to move ahead
- Be patient and nice

## About you!

Give a quick Intro!

- Whats your name?
- Whats your background?
- Why are you interested in Data Science?



## What is Data Science?

Great question! 

Different Companies and people will have different definitions for roles.


In general I like to broadly think of it as "Solving problems using data". 


- Data Collection and storage
- Data Cleaning, prepping
- Analytics, Metrics, gaining insights
- A/B Testing
- AI
	- Machine Learning
	- Deep Learning 


Understanding the business problem is important for each step above.

### Jobs in Data Science

- The Data Analyst
- The Data Engineer
- The Data Science
- Machine Learning Engineer
- Deep Learning Engineer
- Computer Vision Engineer
- Natural Language Processing(NLP) Engineer
- More!


### Who uses Python?

I would say most major companies using Data Science and machine learning. 

Other Languages: Scala, R



#### Popular Frameworks and libraries to keep in mind


- Data Science
	- Pandas 
	- MatplotLib
	- seaborn
	- Tensorflow
	- Keras
	- Numpy
	- Pandas
	- ScikitLearn
	- OpenCV
	- pytorch
	- A BILLION MORE!


*Note*: if you're thinking of exploring data science with python look into using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) to manage your python and data libraries

[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb#recent=true) is a awesome place to start as well without having to install anything!



## What we'll do!

We're going to:

- Understand a dataset
- Visualize the data in a meaningful way
- Use Machine learning to make predictions

For this we're going to use:

- Pandas 
- Matplotlib
- ScikitLearn
